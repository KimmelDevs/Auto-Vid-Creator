# Sound effects library

Free sound effects from Mixkit (mixkit.co), saved as mp3 and sorted into folders.

## Get the sounds

The mp3 files aren't stored in git. Download all of them (about 610 MB) with:

```bash
python sfx/download.py
```

It reads `manifest.json` and skips files you already have.

## How to use them

### Put them in the script (Story Maker Studio)
Write a tag right before the word where the sound should start. The path is relative to this `sfx` folder.

```
[sfx:fight/sword_slash.mp3 vol=40]       one-shot sound at this word
[sfx:human/fast_heartbeat.mp3 vol=35 fade-out]   fades out at its end
[amb:ambience/scary_woods_at_night.mp3 vol=15 loop fade-in]   background loop, keeps playing
[amb-stop:scary_woods_at_night]          stops that loop here (fades out)
[sfx:human/heartbeat_single.mp3 vol=45 x3]   plays 3 times back to back
Easier: Images & Effects > + sound under an object (search, preview, add).
```

- `vol=` is percent (100 = full). Background loops: 8-20. Hits: 30-60.
- `fade-in` / `fade-out` soften the start / end.
- `loop` repeats the file until its `[amb-stop:...]`, or until the video ends.
- After editing the script, press **Rebuild preview** in the Play tab to hear it. Make video uses the same sound mix.
- A wrong file name is skipped and shows `! sound not found` in the build log.

### Find a sound fast
1. Open the folder that matches the moment (for example `fight/` for a hit).
2. Click a file to preview it in Windows Media Player.
3. Or search the whole `sfx` folder in File Explorer, for example `roar`, `scream`, `door`, `rain`.

### Add them to a video (CapCut, Premiere, DaVinci, any editor)
1. Import the finished video from `bunker-ep01\out\...`.
2. Drag the sound file onto an audio track under the video.
3. Line it up with the image it belongs to, a few frames before the action reads best.
4. Turn the volume down so it never covers the voice:
   - background loops (rain, forest, crickets): about 10-20%
   - one-off hits (roar, punch, explosion): about 40-70%
5. Fade background loops in and out (about 1 second each end).

### Tips
- One strong sound per image is enough. Too many sounds make narration hard to hear.
- Put an ambience loop under a whole scene, then add hits on top for the big moments.
- Use a `transitions/` whoosh when the video slides to the next image.
- Use a `heartbeat` under `[heartbeat]` effects and a `door_knock` under `[knock]` effects in the script.
- Use a `ui/` pop or ding at the subscribe pop-up.
- Thunder and explosions sound bigger if the image has a `shake` or `boom` effect at the same time.
